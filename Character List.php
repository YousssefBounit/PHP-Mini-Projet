                    Yamato is the daughter of Kaidou of the Four Emperors.
                    Groomed from a young age to be Kaidou's heir, Yamato
                    instead developed a profound admiration for the samurai
                    Kozuki Oden. After his death, Yamato chose to "become" Oden,
                    impersonating him and adopting his mannerisms.

                    his crew refer to her as such as well.
