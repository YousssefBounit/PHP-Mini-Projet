        <div class="Oda"></div>
        <p><b>Eiichiro Oda</b> est né le 1er janvier 1975 à Kumamoto. Il publie pour la première fois de façon professionnelle
            en 1993 Kami kara mirai no puresento dans le Jump Original d'octobre et remporte le concours de talent mensuel 
            organisé par la rédaction du Weekly Shonen Jump, le Tenkaichi Manga Award, avec sa nouvelle intitulée Ikki Yako.
            En 1994, Eiichiro Oda abandonne l'université et se rend à Tokyo pour devenir l'assistant de trois mangakas travaillant
            pour le Weekly Jump : Shinobu Kaitani, Masaya Tokuhiro et Nobuhiro Watsuki (Kenshin le vagabond). Parallèlement,
            Eiichiro Oda publie deux nouvelles : Monstres dans le Autumn Special de 1994 et la première des deux versions de
            Romance Dawn dans le Summer Special de 1996. Quelques mois plus tard, il fait enfin sa première apparition dans les
            pages du Weekly Shonen Jump avec la deuxième version de Romance Dawn. Eiichiro Oda découvre véritablement le succès
            avec la publication du premier chapitre de son ouvre phare, One Piece, dans le numéro 34 du Weekly Shonen Jump de 1997.
            La série gagne très vite en popularité et devient une référence incontournable du genre shonen au même titre que
            Dragon Ball de Akira Toriyama. Oda est l'un des rares mangakas à avoir dépassé la barre des 100 millions de mangas
            vendus pour une ouvre au Japon et chaque nouveau tome de la série se vend à plus d'un million d'exemplaires.

            <p><b>Kazuya Nakai</b> (中井 和哉, Nakai Kazuya, born November 25, 1967) is a Japanese voice actor and narrator who was
                born in Kobe, Japan. He is affiliated with Aoni Production. His most notable role is Roronoa Zoro from One Piece.
                Other major voice roles include Toshiro Hijikata from Gintama, Date Masamune from Sengoku Basara, Xiahou Dun and
                Dian Wei from Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi series, Shinjiro Aragaki from the Persona series, Mugen from
                Samurai Champloo, Mondo Owada from the Danganronpa series, Ultraman Max in Ultraman Max and Jin Sakai in the
                Japanese dub of the video game Ghost of Tsushima. He won a Best Supporting Actor award at the 5th Seiyu Awards
                in 2011 for his roles in One Piece and Gin Tama.<br>
                Anime and game fans know him for voicing several sword wielding characters such as Hijikata Tōshirō from Gintama,
                Mugen from Samurai Champloo, and Masamune Date in Sengoku Basara. Ironically, Nakai has expressed a personal phobia
                of sharp objects and wouldn't feel comfortable holding a sword. For this reason, he feels pretty alienated from
                these roles. He does associate with their philosophy "to live life as it comes" at least.

                is a Japanese voice actor, actor and narrator who is currently affiliated with Max Mix. 
                He is married to actressNatsuki Hayashi.
                As a child, Yao was very active, building secret bases with his friends and playing outside, and did not watch TV
                much. In addition, because his father was a government official, he had to be transferred every three years, so he
                moved from place to place. When he was in the second year of junior high school, he was transferred to Tokyo, and
                the government office building that he moved into was too small for a TV, so his family decided not to have a TV.
                At that time, his sister, who was four years older than him, and his mother were fond of musicals and plays,
                and Yao accompanied them to see them. At the time, it was popular for kabuki actors to perform William Shakespeare's
                plays, and he saw a Shakespeare play starring Kawarasaki Gonjūrō, and when he saw the stage greeting at the final
                performance of the play, it solidified his desire to become a stage actor. As soon as he graduated from high school
                and went to college, one of the women in his class was the younger sister of Shōichirō Akaboshi, so he started going
                to the rehearsal room of Matenrō Theater Company run by Takuya Hiramitsu with her help, and after being involved in
                a couple of productions as a staff member, he joined the stage as an actor.[4] One of his seniors in the same
                theater company was Hozumi Gōda.
