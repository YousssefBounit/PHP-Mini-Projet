        <P>The series began with the execution of Gul D. Roger, the man known as the "Pirate King" (Kaizokuō?). Before his death,
            Roger announced that his treasure, Alon Pace (11100) (φτ) Wan Pοsu?) It will be available to anyone who finds him,
            causing the beginning of the "Great Pirate Age" (φτí Dai Kaizoku Jidai?). As a result, countless pirates set out to the
            great extent of treasure hunt. The Thuzand Sini "Millennium Sun" has passed twenty-two years since Roger's execution,
            and Monkey Dee set off. Lofi, a young boy inspired by his childhood darling, the powerful pirate "Shanks with red hair,
            " who was a former member of the Pirates of Gol de. Roger is on a journey from the Eastern Blue Sea to look for Alon
            Pace and become the king of pirates. When he searched for the formation of a crew of pirates, straw hat pirates (11)?
            Lofi Syafa, named After Roronwa Zorro, sailed to search for Alon Pace. They met shortly afterwards with Nami, Navigation
            and Tact; Osup, Sniper and Liar, and Sangi, the chef pursuing women; leading to confrontations with Baggy the Clown,
            Captain Koro, and Don Craig. Later, Luffy encountered Aalong, a fish man and a member of the defunct pirate crew, the
            Sun Pirates, who believed the men were the highest-profile fish of humans. After Lofi's defeat to Aerlong, Nami
            officially joined the Lofi crew, and the Navy placed an award at the head of Lofi. Lofi then met captain Smoker,
            a navy captain who could turn into smoke. Smoker arrested Lofi, but the latter got rid of him thanks to his father,
            Monki De. Dragon. After arriving to the great limit, the group met Withritare Fifi, a princess who wanted to help her
            country, the Kingdom of Arbasta, of the criminal group, the organization Baroque Works. They later befriended the
            doctor and the sociable reindeer deer Tony Toni Chuber on the snowy island of Durham.
            The Jyong Miri
            arrived in Arbasta, leading to battles with Baroque Works and their leader, Sir Crocodale. Lovi Defeated Crocodale in
            the end and freed Alabasta. Later, Nico Rubin, an archaeologist and former member of the organization Baroque Works,
            joined the crew. They later met with the black beard, who dreams of becoming king of pirates. After going up to the
            flying island of Skype, the pirates were involved in the war between the Scapians and the Chandori, leading to the
            face of the island's ruler, Enil, who has lightning power. Lofi Enel defeated the island's savior and ended the war.
            The pirates later met Navy Admiral Okigi, who revealed that Nico Rubin was involved in the search for boniglif, rocks
            with symbols abandoned by an ancient civilization to uncover the 100 years lost from the history erased by the world
            government. The pirates went to Watership, opposite the Cyborg ship carpenter Frankie, and discovered that their ship,
            Going Meri, had sailed for the last time and had to be dismantled, leading to Osup's temporary departure from the
            straw hat. Meanwhile, Paul R. 9, the world's government intelligence agency, arrested Nico Rubin and Frankie for
            information about the Boniglef and the old weapons that might be extracted from them. Frankie was freed from
            The Sever Ball after burning old gun schemes and collaborating with straw hat pirates declaring war against the
            government, causing battles between THE C.P.9 and straw hat pirates. The last long battle with CB9.

            and joined them. Shortly afterwards, the pirates helped musician Brock's skeleton regain its shadow at Thriller Park,
            which was stolen by one of the seven Chitschbukai, Giko Moria. After defeating Moria, Brock joined the pirate crew.
            The pirates later prepared to sail towards the New World, the second half of the Great Limit, after reaching the
            Shabundi archipelago. While they were there, they met Syllvers Riley, a former member of Roger's pirate crew who asked
            him to cover their ship so they could travel underwater. In the end, pirates dispersed during a battle with Bartholomew
            Kuma, a huge cyborg under navy control, in the Shabundi archipelago, with Lofi sent to Women's Island - only, Amazon
            Lilly. After learning that his older brother, Portgas de Ace, was being held at the Government Prison of Temple Down,
            Luffy went there and freed several prisoners, including The Fish Man's Genby and some of his old enemies. Lofi later
            learned that Ace was in Marinford to be executed. However, war broke out between the Navy and a group of pirates led
            by the legendary pirate, White Beard. After the chaos, the battle ended with the death of Ace and the white beard,
            Edward Newgate. At Riley's request,
            Lovey ordered the rest of his crew to undergo strict training systems, together under the training of prominent people.
            Two years later, the crew regrouped in the Shabundi archipelago and moved towards Eugene Island , the fish men,
            to enter the New World. At that time, a group of Eugene pirates emerged, seeking sovereignty over human beings,
            and carrying out a coup to determine the fate of the island. Meanwhile, after Nami Jinbe for forgave Orling for
            launching in Eastern Blue, straw hat pirates defeated eugene pirates, the island's rescuers. Hay hat pirates left
            Eugene Island and finally arrived in the New World, but not before the beginning of enmity with

            one of the world's four most powerful pirates, Big Mam. As they entered the flaming half-and-freezing island,
            Bank Hazzard, the pirates met an old friend and a new warlord, Trafalgar Lao, and formed an alliance to defeat
            the four most powerful pirates in the New World, the "Four Emperors" (¹ Yonkō?). The alliance was drawn into a
            fierce battle against Cesar Clune, the scientist responsible for the destruction of Bank Hazzard four years ago.
            After Cesar's defeat, the alliance went towards Drisruza, a kingdom under Don Kihoti Duflamingo, in an attempt to
            destroy the Samael factory as a second stage to defeat one of the four emperors, Kaido. They are now in the midst
            of bloody battles, with Lofi participating in the competition held by Duflamingo when he learned that the prize was
            Ace's Mira Mira Nomi fruit, and here he knows that his other brother Sabo is still alive, exchanging roles where
            Love goes to fight Duflamin. While Sabo fights for mira mira fruit, Sabo eventually has the fruit as Lovi and Lao
            begin fighting Duflamingo and Trebol as the "top outlet in the family", while the Navy is present with its new admiral
            Fujitura. Shortly thereafter, Lofi Duflamingo defeated the island's savior and those in it, and other events began in
            Doresuruza. De Flamengo's barrier disappeared and the joy returned to Doresuruza. Shortly after the Doresuruza events,
            one of the four emperors, Kaido, was unveiled and the crew split into two Loffey teams going to save Sangi from Big Mam,
            Lao and Zorro, waiting for their return to the alliance with Mink, Ninja and 
            Samurai to eliminate the king of the Kaido monsters.
